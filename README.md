# Remote Control for Denon

A Denon receiver type 3310 for example can be controlled via serial, telnet or http requests.

Through telnet you can only send one command at a time:
telnet connect, send command, telnet disconnect, and again and again :(

There are a lot of pdf's available, which explain the denon protocol in depth.
The different types of receivers also have different commands, sometimes also for the same functionalities.
